## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Real-time Video Transmission**  
  View the USB camera feed in real time via browser. Equipped with a high-resolution lens and stable MJPEG streaming.

- **Webpage Remote Control**  
  Control the vehicle via webpage (start/stop/steering).

- **Personnel Detection Support**  
  I2C-based deep-learning-ready external module for personnel detection (optional).

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

The system is composed of multiple concurrent modules using C++ multithreading and Boost.Asio asynchronous timers.

### 1. Hardware Control Module (STM32)

This serves as the lower control layer of the vehicle, handling posture sensing, OLED display, self-balancing, button detection, etc.

### 2. Overall Architecture

- **capture_frames()**  
  Vision + tracking + state machine logic (30ms interval)

- **get_distance()**  
  Ultrasonic ranging, updates global `distance` variable (100ms interval)

- **temp_control()**  
  Temperature PID control and Peltier management (200ms interval)

- **HTTP Server**  
  Based on `cpp-httplib` for video streaming + JSON API control

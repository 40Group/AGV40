## ALL IN ALL:
The SafetyController class ensures the safe operation of a smart medical transport robot by continuously monitoring environmental and system conditions. It integrates four critical components: a motor controller, ultrasonic sensor, infrared sensor, and temperature controller. Once initialized, it launches a dedicated safety monitoring thread that runs periodically every 100 milliseconds.This controller evaluates three main safety aspects: obstacle detection (via ultrasonic and infrared sensors), thermal safety (based on temperature readings), and system health (status of all modules). Depending on the results, it transitions between safety states such as NORMAL, OBSTACLE_DETECTED, TEMPERATURE_EMERGENCY, SYSTEM_ERROR, and EMERGENCY_STOP. Each emergency has a corresponding handler that logs the event, stops the motors, and takes appropriate recovery actions.The controller also provides methods for validating motor commands, applying speed constraints based on proximity, and managing manual emergency stops. It keeps a limited-size log of safety-related events and supports system self-testing. Thresholds for temperature and obstacle proximity can be adjusted at runtime.Overall, the SafetyController acts as a centralized fault detection and response unit, ensuring both environmental awareness and operational reliability in real-time

All in all, This vision tracking module is built on OpenCV and performs image preprocessing through grayscale conversion, filtering, adaptive thresholding, and morphological operations. It applies ROI-based masking and probabilistic Hough transform for efficient line detection, then extracts key navigation metrics such as lateral offset, orientation angle, and detection confidence. Additionally, integrated performance monitoring ensures that frame rate and latency meet the real-time and stability requirements of smart medical vehicle navigation.

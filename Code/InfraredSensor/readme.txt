Real Event-Driven Infrared Sensor Module
========================================

Purpose: Hardware interrupt-based obstacle detection using REAL GPIO events

Files:
- InfraredSensor.h: Real event-driven class declaration
- InfraredSensor.cpp: Hardware interrupt implementation
- test_infrared.cpp: Real-time event test program
- readme.txt: This file

Hardware Requirements:
- 2x IR obstacle sensors (digital output)
- GPIO connections:
  * Left sensor: GPIO 19 (default)
  * Right sensor: GPIO 26 (default)
- Built-in pull-up resistors via gpiod

REAL Event-Driven Architecture:
===============================
✅ NO POLLING - Pure hardware interrupt driven
✅ gpiod.hpp - Modern Linux GPIO interface
✅ Sub-millisecond response time
✅ Thread-safe atomic state updates
✅ True real-time compliance

Technical Implementation:
========================
- Uses gpiod::line::EVENT_BOTH_EDGES for real hardware interrupts
- gpiod::line::event_wait() blocks until actual GPIO state changes
- No sleep() statements for timing - pure event-driven
- Atomic state variables for thread-safe access
- Hardware event timestamps for latency analysis

GPIO Event Configuration:
========================
Left Sensor:  gpiod::line with BOTH_EDGES interrupt
Right Sensor: gpiod::line with BOTH_EDGES interrupt
Pull-up:      FLAG_BIAS_PULL_UP via gpiod
Detection:    FALLING_EDGE = obstacle detected
              RISING_EDGE  = obstacle cleared

Compilation (CMake only):
========================
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

Dependencies:
============
- libgpiod-dev (modern GPIO library)
- C++17 or later
- pthread

## ALL In ALL:
In this project, the main.cpp file serves as the central coordinator of all system modules. It begins by initializing the timer manager, which is then passed to each component to enable unified event scheduling. Modules such as the motor controller, vision tracker, infrared and ultrasonic sensors, temperature controller, and safety controller are all created using smart pointers and initialized through a consistent interface.Callback functions are registered in a dedicated setup routine to handle sensor events such as obstacle detection and visual tracking. Each component runs independently based on timer-driven or GPIO-triggered events. The main thread itself remains idle after initialization, relying entirely on the event-driven design to handle real-time behaviors.This structure separates initialization, callback registration, and service activation into clear stages, ensuring organized control flow and asynchronous task execution across the system.

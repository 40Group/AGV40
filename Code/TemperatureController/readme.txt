Real Event-Driven Temperature Controller Module
===============================================

PURPOSE:
Hardware interrupt-driven precision temperature control using REAL event-based PID control

ARCHITECTURE CHANGE:
===================
❌ OLD: Polling control loop + wiringPi + sleep() timing + MCP3004
✅ NEW: Pure event-driven + gpiod.hpp + timer callbacks + immediate response

FEATURES:
- Event-driven PID control algorithm
- Real GPIO hardware control via gpiod
- Timer-based temperature monitoring (no polling)
- Immediate emergency shutdown response
- Thread-safe atomic temperature control
- Pure callback-driven operation

MEDICAL APPLICATION:
- Medication storage: 2-8°C (vaccines, insulin)
- Blood products: 1-6°C
- Room temperature drugs: 15-25°C
- Heat-sensitive supplies: <30°C

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
- Temperature sensor (I2C/SPI or analog)
- Peltier cooling element
- Heating resistor element
- Relay modules for heater/cooler control

GPIO PIN CONFIGURATION (gpiod):
- Heater Control: GPIO 5 (default)
- Cooler Control: GPIO 6 (default)
- Temperature Sensor: GPIO 4 (or I2C/SPI interface)

REAL EVENT-DRIVEN OPERATION:
===========================
✅ Timer-based temperature reading (no polling loops)
✅ Event-driven PID calculations
✅ Immediate GPIO control response
✅ Callback-triggered temperature monitoring
✅ Zero continuous polling for control

CONTROL ALGORITHM (Event-Driven):
=================================
PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control triggered by timer events:
- Proportional gain (Kp): 2.0 (default, atomic)
- Integral gain (Ki): 0.1 (default, atomic)
- Derivative gain (Kd): 0.05 (default, atomic)
- Control event frequency: Timer-driven (1Hz default)

API USAGE (Event-Driven):
=========================
- Initialize: controller.initialize()
- Register timer: controller.registerTimerCallback(timer_function)
- Start control: controller.start()
- Event trigger: controller.processTemperatureControlEvent()
- Set target: controller.setTargetTemperature(25.0)
- Emergency stop: controller.emergencyTemperatureShutdown()

CALLBACK INTEGRATION:
====================
TemperatureCallback for real-time temperature events:
controller.registerCallback([](double temperature) {
    safety.updateTemperatureHealth();
    safety.checkTemperatureEvent(temperature);
    LOG_INFO("Temperature: " + std::to_string(temperature) + "°C");
});

Timer callback for event-driven control:
controller.registerTimerCallback([](auto callback, auto delay) {
    timerManager.scheduleEvent(callback, delay);
});

CONTROL STATES (Immediate):
==========================
- IDLE: Temperature within target range (±0.5°C)
- HEATING: Temperature below target, heater immediately active
- COOLING: Temperature above target, cooler immediately active  
- MAINTAINING: Fine adjustments to maintain target

REAL-TIME COMPLIANCE:
====================
✅ Zero polling loops for temperature control
✅ Timer-based event-driven temperature monitoring
✅ Immediate GPIO state changes (<100μs)
✅ Sub-millisecond emergency response
✅ Thread-safe atomic temperature parameters
✅ Pure callback-driven architecture
